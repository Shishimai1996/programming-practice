Finds the peak index in an array of integers representing the heights of mountains.
A mountain is considered a peak if its height is greater than its neighboring mountains.
The first and last mountains in the array are compared to their single adjacent mountain.

@param heights: The array of mountain heights.
@return: The index of the peak mountain, or -1 if no peak is found.

public static int findPeakIndex(int[] heights) {
return -1; // return -1 if no peak is found

Public static void main(String[] args) {
 int[] heights = {1,3,5,2,1};
 int[] peakIndex = findPeakIndex(heights);
System.out.printIn(“Peak index:” + peakIndex); // Peak index:2
